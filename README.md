   A text adventure game for the C64


Welcome to Ascension, an isolated volcanic island in the mid-Atlantic, lying about one thousand miles off the west coast of Africa and some sixteen hundred miles east of Brazil. Ascension is governed as part of the British Overseas Territories with Georgetown acting as entry point for overseas visitors. The year is 1965 and despite it's name, Georgetown is best described as a village. The island's population declined sharply after De Beers closed it's mining operations here in 1953. Today the population stands at just 85.

Islanders rely mainly on fishing as a source of income but supplimented by offering intrepid visitors the occassional guided tour up Green Mountain and on to it's creator lake. Set back from the picturesque harbour is what's considered the heart of Georgetown, a cobbled square faced by St Mary's church, a storybook mix of pretty white-washed cottages, an olde post office and the islands only pub, the Friars Inn, where you have a room for the duration of your stay. 

There's no airstrip on Ascension, no plane could ever hope to cover the distance. To get here, travellers need to board a supply ship that departs Walvis Bay on Namibia's skeleton coast once a month. The most stand out feature as you approach the island is Green Mountain, a breathtaking caldera type volcano that looms over the horizon sweeping majestically skyward to a height of nine and a half thousand feet. When it's upper slopes aren't enveloped in a layer of cloud, you can see the old Monastery built in the simple Cistercian architectial style situated on a rocky outcrop four thousand feet above sea level. The Monastery was home to a myterious brethren sect for about 300 years. Not much is known apart from a book kept behind a glass case at St. Mary's which documents the meticulous detailed records of the Monks day to day lives.

The monestary dates back to the time of the English Reformation. Built as a sanctuary by order of the Pope in wake of King Henry VIII' dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. Much of the islands history centers around this. Visitors are able to book guided walks around George Town which take in centerious old hieroglyphic symbols found carved into rocks and buildings. No one knows how they came to be there or what they might represent. It is a real enigma for Ascenion. 

An organized expedition is expected to be announced in the coming months which hopes to access the Monastery. If successful, it will be the first time the outside world learns of this incredibly isoltated and mystrious place, perhaps opening it up to tourism to benefit the local economy.


Heading out of Georgetown on the islands only sealed road takes you past the old De Beers mining works and the remains of it's numerious corrugated tin shacks that once housed it's transient workforce. Some of the mines are said to run right under Georgetown itself. A little further on and the road comes to a fork with the lower road continuing east, while the other climbs north becoming increasingly inclined, degraded and overgrown as it meanders it's way towards the monastery. Sometime in the late 17th century, the higher elevations of the road were lost due to a major landslide and as a result there's no way to reach it today. This hasn't prevented the adventure types from trying of course. Rock falls are common and locals are often called upon to recuse the ill-prepared from it's treacherous slopes. All failed to reach the monestary, but one.

In 1896 a gentleman by the name of James Augustus, a man of advancing years and a retired Lecturer from Penn State university had visited the island. Taking up lodgings at the Friars Inn he spent most evenings drinking with locals buying beers for those willing to listen to his wild outlandish theories of Ascension and stories of plundered treasures. Naturally he became very popular. During the day he was unusually quiet and reserved, preferring instead to keep to himself and was often seen walking around the examining things up close as if looking for clues. One on particular evening he stood up on a chair, rised his pint glass in the air and made an announcement -

"I have found a way to enter the monestary! Come first light I shall journey there and lay claim to all the treasures therein."

Fishermen landing their early morning catch waved him off as he set out along the road towards Green Mountain. As the sun went down that evening, locals assembled in the village square as instructed and were astonished to see his lantern waving side to side from the bell tower. Sadly they were never to see him again. Nobody quite knows how he managed to get up there or why he failed to return. Augustus was both a sholar of classical antiquity and ancient Mesoamerican history. He come to be on Ascension due to his own personal obsession with the islands links with the Mayian civilization and of plundered treasure!

His story goes something like this - During the reign of King Philip II of Spain, numerous expeditions to the New World were taking place. The Conquistadors were plundering ancient Mayan cities in central America and returning with galleons laden with treasure to help finance the King's war with England. However, the Conquistadors being greedy for wealth and power devised a plan to keep as much of the gold for themselves. On returning from one particularly successful expedition they stopped off at Ascension Island and deposited half of all their treasure with the Monastery.

They offered the Monks a sizable donation for it's safe keeping and vowed to return the following year to collect it, but as the years rolled by and no sign of the Conquistadors returning, the monks used the treasure to improve their own impoverished lives and the lives of the islanders. They built St Mary's church, the village square, cottages for the fishermen, fortified the harbour, and commissioned a new gravel road to replace the treatrious path that led to the Monastery.

It is known that the Monks often visited the village to trade gold figurines and artifacts for everyday mundane items such as tools and weaved baskets. How they came to be in possession of the gold seems to have given much credence to his story. People living on the island claim that on some evenings, if you lay quietly in your bed you can hear through an open window the faintly distant ringing of a lone bell at the Monastery, with some even claiming to have seen the ghost of James Augustus roaming the village at night. There are old stories too of strange lights in the skies above green mountain that would slowly descend into its mist covered creator and shake the ground knocking picture frames to the floor.
